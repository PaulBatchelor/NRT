NRT = Note, Rhythm, Timing

pronounced "Nurt"

The main point of this language would be to allow people to quickly notate musical motifs

It will largely based on the Lilypond and ABC notation syntax

goals:
twitter "one-liner" mindset
ryhthm and pitch representation
syntactical sugar 
polyphony
accidentals
NO meter, but optional use of bars (they will be ignored)
