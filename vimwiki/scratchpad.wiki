This one may be a big long rant since I just started this thing, so here we go.

First things first, NRT should write to STDOUT instead of an array of structs. 
This is safer, and it can allow for further user extension via unix utilities.

The NRT output should be comma separated values, like so:

$ ./nrt input.nrt
0,0.5,60
0.5,0.5,62
0.5,0.5,64
0.5,0.5,65

From there, NRT could be piped into something like awk or perl to generate
JSON files or csound scores. The example files should have these. 
---
NRT should also be able to read from STDIN... but that isn't too large of a
concern yet... 
---
A distant possibility is to create a NRT API of sorts to embed NRT inside of other
applications (think project Blake).

A NRT string goes in, and a data structure comes out. I'd rather not roll my own
data structure in C, so I'll probably learn how to use something like gnulib.

---

Metacharacters. We need metacharacters for algorithmic, generative stuff.

Things like:

* Repetition
* Choices
* Retrograde
* Transposition
* Scale filters

And stuff like that.

...Phew. That wasn't too bad.
