NRT
---

NRT (Note, Rhythm, Timing, or "nurt") is a music notation system designed specifically
for algorithmic composers. 

NRT syntax looks very similar to music notation languages like Lilypond or ABC notation,
except that NRT uses a movable-do system of solfege to represent note values.


Compilation
---
At the moment, NRT can be compiled by running "make" in the top directory.

To install, run "sudo make install".

NRT only needs flex and bison installed for it to work.
